      "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
      <span>pleasure</span> and praising <span>pain</span> was born and I will
      give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
      teachings of the great <span>explorer</span> of the truth, the
      master-builder of human <span> happiness</span>. No one rejects, dislikes,
      or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who
      do not know how to pursue pleasure <span>rationally </span> encounter
      consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
      loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
      but because occasionally <span> circumstances</span> occur in which toil
      and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
      which of us ever undertakes <span>laborious </span> physical exercise,
      except to obtain some <span>advantage </span> from it? But who has any
      right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
      annoying <span>consequences </span> , or one who avoids a pain that
      produces no resultant pleasure?"
